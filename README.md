## Project Requirements
* Initializing Repository, Readme.md

* Use props
* Use state 
* Demonstrate reusable components
* User-friendly (is this easy to use for the user? Hint: you have classmates who are excellent testers for your project.) 
* Written from scratch (i.e. do not repurpose other peopleâ€™s code) 
* Mobile-friendly (i.e. you want to eventually pull this app up on your phone to show a potential recruiter or someone in the tech community if * you are out at an event.) 
* Responsiveness 
* Unique and readable design - Be Creative!
* Understand the project enough to be able to present it
